git init: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.

git push: Pushes committed changes from your local repository to a remote repository, such as GitHub or GitLab.  
git status: Shows the current status of your working directory, including changes that are staged or not staged for commit.  
git log: Displays a log of all commits in the repository, showing commit messages, authors, dates, and commit hashes.  
git pull: Fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into your local branch.  
git branch: Lists all branches in the repository and highlights the current branch.  
git checkout: Switches between branches or commits, allowing you to work on different parts of your project.  
git merge: Combines changes from one branch into another, typically used to integrate feature branches into the main branch.  
git diff: Shows the differences between two commits, branches, or files.  
git remote -v: Lists the remote repositories that your local repository is connected to and shows their URLs.  
git fetch: Downloads objects and refs from another repository, updating your remote-tracking branches.
